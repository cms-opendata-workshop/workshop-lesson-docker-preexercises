These pre-exercises are designed to prepare you for using Docker in the context of
the CMS Open Data Workshop. This is *not* a full introduction to Docker, however
we do take time to explain some key concepts that should make your experience a smooth one. 

Note that you can also use virtual machines (VMs) to interface with the CERN Open Data Portal
and this workshop and there is a separate pre-exercise for that. 

You should definitely take time to go through either this or the VM exercise before
participating in the workshop. 

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers.
